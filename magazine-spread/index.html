        Some private individual — a Pentagon whose name is variously reported —
        having casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a
        rudimentary method of painting, is said to have begun decorating first
        his house, then his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and Grandsons,
        lastly himself. The convenience as well as the beauty of the results
        commended themselves to all.

        The fashion spread like wildfire. Before a week was over, every Square
        and Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes,
        and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out. A
        month or two found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation. A
        year had not elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very
        highest of the Nobility. Needless to say, the custom soon made its way
        from the district of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within two
        generations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women and
        the Priests.

        Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific — call them by what names
        you will — yet, from an aesthetic point of view, those ancient days of
        the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland — a
        childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached the
        blossom of youth. To live was then in itself a delight, because living
        implied seeing. Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to
        behold; the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre
        are said to have more than once proved too distracting for our greatest
        teachers and actors; but most ravishing of all is said to have been the
        unspeakable magnificence of a military review.
