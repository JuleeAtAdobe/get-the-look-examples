        <h1>Of the Doctrine of our Priests</h1>
        <p>
          As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a
          single maxim, &ldquo;Attend to your Configuration.&rdquo; Whether
          political, ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its
          object the improvement of individual and collective Configuration
          &mdash; with special reference of course to the Configuration of the
          Circles, to which all other objects are subordinated.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually Suppressed
          those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in
          the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,
          encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration. It was
          Pantocyclus &mdash; the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the
          queller of the Colour Revolt &mdash; who first convinced mankind that
          Configuration makes the man; that if, for example, you are born an
          Isosceles with two uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong unless
          you have them made even &mdash; for which purpose you must go to the
          Isosceles Hospital; similarly, if you are a Triangle, or Square, or
          even a Polygon, born with any Irregularity, you must be taken to one
          of the Regular Hospitals to have your disease cured; otherwise you
          will end your days in the State Prison or by the angle of the State
          Executioner.
        </p>
        <p>
          All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most
          flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from
          perfect Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not
          congenital) by some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise,
          or by taking too much of it; or even by a sudden change of
          temperature, resulting in a shrinkage or expansion in some too
          susceptible part of the frame. Therefore, concluded that illustrious
          Philosopher, neither good conduct nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in
          any sober estimation, for either praise or blame. For why should you
          praise, for example, the integrity of a Square who faithfully defends
          the interests of his client, when you ought in reality rather to
          admire the exact precision of his right angles? Or again, why blame a
          lying, thievish Isosceles when you ought rather to deplore the
          incurable inequality of his sides?
        </p>
        <p>
          Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical
          drawbacks. In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he
          cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for
          that very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his
          neighbours, you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be
          consumed &mdash; and there&rsquo;s an end of the matter. But in little
          domestic difficulties, where the penalty of consumption, or death, is
          out of the question, this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in
          awkwardly; and I must confess that occasionally when one of my own
          Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse for his disobedience that a
          sudden change of the temperature has been too much for his perimeter,
          and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration,
          which can only be strengthened by abundance of the choicest
          sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to reject, nor practically
          to accept, his conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding
          or castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my
          Grandson&rsquo;s Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds
          for thinking so. At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating
          myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,
          sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular
          and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that,
          when scolding their children, they speak about "right" or "wrong" as
          vehemently and passionately as if they believed that these names
          represented real existences, and that a human Figure is really capable
          of choosing between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration the
          leading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature of that
          Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents
          and children. With you, children are taught to honour their parents;
          with us &mdash; next to the Circles, who are the chief object of
          universal homage &mdash; a man is taught to honour his Grandson, if he
          has one; or, if not, his Son. By &ldquo;honour,&rdquo; however, is by
          no means meant &ldquo;indulgence,&rdquo; but a reverent regard for
          their highest interests: and the Circles teach that the duty of
          fathers is to subordinate their own interests to those of posterity,
          thereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as well as that of
          their own immediate descendants.
